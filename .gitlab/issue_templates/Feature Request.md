## Description
<!-- 
  Explain what this is about, try to use full sentences, and make your point clear.
-->
We want to be able to see more information on parts of the form from within the app
with a "More Info" button. It'd be nice if it could open a side panel on the side
where we can continue using the app and filling out the fields while the documentation
is displayed on the side.

## Motivation
<!--
  Why is this a feature that should be implemented in this project?
-->
It'd make it much easier to use and learn how to use ImageCaster and ImageCaster GUI,
especially where not everyone might not what a setting is, or remember the syntax 
for certain strings like the sizes.

## Interface
<!--
  In some cases you may wish to propose an interface
  to help describe how you'd want to use this, or for others to discuss
  and improve ahead of time before final implementation.
-->
A "More Info" button on some sections, and a documentation button
to view all documentation in general in a side panel, without being taken
to an external website. It'd be better if it worked entirely offline.
